	"bio": "The serene town of Pokémon was once home to two extraordinary beings: Theta and Gamma. From birth, Theta was unique—a fusion, though her powers remained dormant, rendering her unable to harness any of her inherent abilities. Orion, a celestial observer, watched over her with great interest as she navigated this limitation with remarkable creativity and resilience. \n\nOne fateful day, Gamma's mischievous pranks led to Theta being banished from their hometown. Misfortune was often blamed on her due to her unusual nature, casting a shadow of misfortune over her. Orion, intrigued by Theta’s ingenious adaptations and unyielding spirit, bestowed upon her the power of creation. With this divine gift, she became the Goddess of Creation, capable of crafting and merging universes according to her whims. ",

After pleas from Gamma for Orion to not leave him alone after taking his sister, Orion took interest in Gamma's chaotic influence and granted him lesser creative power of his sister, yet some destructive capabilities, transforming him into the God of Chaos. With his newfound power, Gamma reveled in the freedom to sow discord. With Theta’s newly crafted worlds, he decided to play a role, adding layers of unpredictability and dynamic energy to the realms she created together.",

Their graduation was abruptly halted by the return of Litih, an exiled dark mage whose defeat required all their combined skill. Following the ceremony’s conclusion, Solstice chose a path diverging from her peers, seeking solitude on a remote Isle where she could connect with her own kind. \n\nHowever, survival demanded compromise, and she reluctantly accepted a position as an assassin under the ruthless Lucario leader, Reaper. The weight of each life taken chipped away at her soul until she encountered Krow, a young Grovyle whose vulnerability resonated deeply within her. Unable to reconcile Reaper’s brutality with her conscience, Solstice defied his orders, rescuing Krow and plotting an escape. \n\nSeeking refuge and purpose, Solstice infiltrated a newly forming Scouts clan, where she met Keith, Theodore, and Lora – individuals who would become invaluable allies. Together, they exposed Reaper’s operation, transforming the Scouts into The Pathfinder Guild, an organization dedicated to exploration, protection, and justice. Solstice now embraces a life of peace and camaraderie within the Guild, finally finding belonging and using her strength for good – a far cry from the solitary assassin she once was.",

Having many different adventures in the wild, like finding treasure, meeting new people, and even saving a town from a tornado. He would meet a Nightfury named Vulkor, who showed him the ways of living in the wilds. Vulkor was basically the parental figure he never had. They fed, bathed, and protected Milo from all danger because he was too kind, innocent, and trusting to fight back. After years of growing, Milo decided to buy a plot of land, and started to plant crops, grow fruits, vegetables, flowers, and trees, while also trying to help the local communities and townsfolk.",

For generations, these females have honed their skills as killers, a tradition passed down through rigorous training and steeped in ancient rituals. Brite was raised from birth to embody this legacy, enduring relentless drills and mastering deadly techniques alongside her classmates, Silvia and Solstice. Their graduation ceremony—a culmination of years of dedication—was tragically disrupted by the sudden reappearance of Lilith, an exiled student rumored to be a user of Dark Magic. \n\nThe defeat of Lilith left Brite grappling with conflicting emotions: pride in her tribe’s strength and a lingering unease about the implications of Dark Magic plaging other parts of the world. Seeking answers and a purpose beyond the confines of tradition, she journeyed East towards a region surrounded by impenetrable overgrowth. Tales circulated throughout the Druron Kingdom spoke of those who dared to enter never returning, attributing their fate to possible use of dark magic. Driven by a desire to protect others from the unseen dangers and perhaps find a way to reconcile her skills with a more peaceful existence, Brite has embarked on a perilous quest—one that may lead her to confront not only external threats but also the very foundations of her beliefs. \n\n«Iteration Log: Druronian Tribal Slugcat»\nDesignation: The Warrior \nNotes: This slugcat is peculiar; she doesn't seem to have come from either the City or the Slugcat Colony below. From the markings I can trace, it originates from a tribe in Druron. It’s strange that this creature managed to wander so far and even climb my very structure.
