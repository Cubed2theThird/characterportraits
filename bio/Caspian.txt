Caspian is one of the three Ancient Guardians of The Isle. Constantly seen relaxing, eating apples on their mountain. Used to mostly care for themself, until meeting a special Mew that would change their morals for the better. Now they are always watching the Island from a distance, only to appearing if it is in danger. Last sighted during "The Great Fire", helping Benjamin putting out the fire while he saved the fleeing pokemon. Myths been formed after their first sighting, never to be seen again in public. Many attempts to search for them, but could never find a trace. Only a few knows of their existence being true, but only Apostle Wake knows of their resting location.
