Flumf is deranged, mentally insane/unstable, and messy fur

Flumf's family was kind of close, but not as close as Resha's. He always looked up to his older Zekrom Brother. Those two we're the closes between the three, but all three still cared for each other. After a fight with shadow creatures, Zekrom sacrificed himself to let Flumf escape. Crimson out of anger blamed Flumf for their brother's Death, and sought to kill him out of revenge. Left defeated, Flumf was saved by Resha fusing with him in order to keep him alive. Years of recovering, he gained enough consciousness to force Resha to defuse with him. Stuck in his old days, upon release he caused mayhem to the land, now gaining the attention of both Crimson and Theta. He knew he would have to reface his Brother soon....

After Crimson heard of his brother's death, he blamed Flumf for it, and sought for revenge. Nearly killing Flumf to then leave him to die on his own. Unknown to him Resha found him on the brink of death, and decided to fuse with Flumf. Believing he was the last of his family, he would go on a massacre for domination of the world. Years past until he felt a connection to his brother awaken again. Now with the confirmation that his brother is alive. He aims to finish what started.
