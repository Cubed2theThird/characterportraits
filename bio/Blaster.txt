Blaster's been for the people all his life. Greeting any newcomers to the Isle, and making many friends along the way. He has seen many things that some should never see, but made it his goal so nobody would have to see it. After being hired by Apostle Wake, it now made his goals possible to serve and protect the people from harm. Making friends with Tyler taught him to not let hardship bring him down, and to have as much fun as possible while doing what he likes. Now he's been called to action to hunt down the elusive target that stole the Ventus Maelstrom Staff.
