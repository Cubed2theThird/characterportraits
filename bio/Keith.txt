Keith the Diamond Hakamo-o is the creator of Acryliccs Arts. He's a pretty jolly, naïve, and caring guy. Used to living with Resha's family, becoming besties with Kyu and Victoria, and like a little brother to Zeku. The massive fight between Flumf and Crimson, would caused the family to split apart. Resha would give Keith the ownership of KAC before removing all contacts. Keith currently travels across the world in hopes of finding her again, but one thing for sure is that he'll never abandon his substitute doll friend, Fern. Now he finds himself on The Isle, meeting the locals while keeping his connections to the legendries a secret. He would eventually meet and form a relationship with Theodore, who would later help Keith in his adventures in finding his caretaker.
