Milo was born in the Druron kingdom to a royal family, but ever since he was a child, wanted to explore the world and make new friends! So he left the kingdom to explore the wild world all by himself to live a simple and happy life in the countryside. He had to hunt to survive, training with his body and mind to defend his self. Having many different adventures in the wild, like finding treasure, meeting new people, and even saving a town from a tornado. He would meet a Nightfury named Vulkor, who showed him the ways of living in the wilds. Vulkor was basically the parental figure he never had. They fed, bathed, and protected Milo from all danger because he was too kind, innocent, and trusting to fight back. After years of growing, Milo decided to buy a plot of land, and started to plant crops, grow fruits, vegetables, flowers, and trees, while also trying to help the local communities and townsfolk.
