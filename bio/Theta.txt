Theta is the goddess of creation

Theta grew up in a small pokemon town, but instead of being a normal mon she came out as a fusion. A fusion that had one problem. She couldn't use any of her own powers. Orion continued to observe her throughout many years before one day she was finally banished out of her hometown for being consider too much of a freak and dangerous. After taking a lot of interest in her creativity in finding ways around her lack of powers, and her wonder for any other possible life in the universe. Orion gave her the powers to create anything she wanted. Now she's the God of Creation. Creating and merging universes to her liking. Eventually joined by her new stepbrother Delta, then later her friend Kuromori to further expand their universes.
