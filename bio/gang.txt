they gang disbanded after alot of infighting so it's just Luca and maybe Typhlo left
Luca being leader and ty 2nd in command after Hereford left
The Isle was at war for who to lead it. With everyone wanting to take that responsibility it was when the gang formed to make Lucario the leader of the Isle and to make it true they were to kill anyone that could pose a threat to that goal, but to keep the attention off them much they would pose as the superheros by also eliminating criminals (outside of their group ofc) 

He was the second greatest assassin in the group but had morals of his own 
Mostly he wouldn't kill unless threatened of his friends or family was (which at the time was just the group) he was hanging out with one chick then they later became mates which later became intimate where they had a kid
Now that he had a family he was more focused on protecting them vs killing that after the fire he lost his mate and left the group to instead protect his son instead

Hereford was an assassin but when the great fire happened he lost his lover and was left with his son so he converted his ways and made the Guardians to protect others from harm
